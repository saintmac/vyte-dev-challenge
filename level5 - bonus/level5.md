This one is a bonus level.
You can submit your test without completing it.
Obviously we'll appreciate if you took the time to comlete it nonetheless.

The goal here is to test what you've done in the previous levels.
 * [ ] For n in [1...4], write a `leveln_test.js`script that unit test the code you built in that level.
 * running `node level1_test.js` should for instance try creating appointments with the `Appointment` class and ensure that the addAttendee and removeAttendee methods work as expected. The script should return successfully if everything behaves as expected and fail otherwise.

 If you are familiar with javascript testing frameworks like mocha, jasmine etc you can use them, but if you do not, don't worry just implement something simple in raw javascript.
